I'm just an self-learning programming enthusiast that like to learn about programming in my free time.
This is just my experimental kernel for Poco X3 Pro(vayu), will be mostly focuses on hid-sony and hid-playstation.
Feel free to be my guest but use the codes at your own risk, I won't responsible for anything happened to your phone.

Things done:
Added necessary drivers for the phone to operate properly:
  - Wifi driver
  - Audio driver (mandatory, or else the phone won't boot into system)
  - Data driver
  - Exfat file system
Sony playstation 4/5 controllers related changes:
  - Enabled force feedback(vibration) for Sony PS4 controller(Dualshock 4) - hid-sony
  - Added Sony PS5 controller(Dualsense/Edge) - hid-playstation support.
    ( Both sony driver sources upstreamed to latest commit available(as of 20221101),
      with some backport and exclusion for hid-playstation (specifically 20221027 commit) )
    ( Dualshock 4 coding will soon be migrated to hid-playstation as announced by the maintainer )


Things to do:
  - trying to expand hid-sony and hid-playstation functionality.
  
  
Things to find out:
  - where to start android app development?
  - how to convert kernel device driver to android userspace driver?
  - how to execute linux binary from android app?
 (Please lead me to correct paths)
